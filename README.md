## üåç **What is GreenCycle?**

GreenCycle enables users to:
- **Scan items** to determine recyclability.
- **Locate nearby recycling centers** with ease.
- **Earn rewards** for recycling efforts.

Our app addresses common challenges in recycling:
- **Ambiguity**: Not all items, such as Styrofoam medication packaging, are recyclable.
- **Lack of Incentive**: Recycling can feel inconvenient and unrewarding.

## üöÄ **Motivation**

- **Recyclable Waste**: 75% of the waste we generate is recyclable, yet much of it ends up in landfills.
- **Economic Impact**: If all recyclable waste were processed, the global market potential exceeds **$234 billion per year**. Even on a smaller scale, Princeton alone could generate **$904,000 annually** through recycling.

## üéÆ **Features & Value Add**

- **Gamification**: Inspired by successful apps, GreenCycle makes recycling engaging and rewarding.
- **Monetary Incentives**: Users earn money based on their recycling contributions.
